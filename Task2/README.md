# cv2
### Tutorial1 folder
        1. basics
            - This folder contains cv2_Read_write.ipynb and cv2_video.ipynb which explain the basics 
            of image reading and writing. 2nd file contain how to play video using cv2 and also record
            video using webcam.
        2. arithmetic_operations
            - In this arithmetic_operations.ipynb file images blend, images add, images subtract images
              implemented.
        3. controlling_brightness
            - In this folder file contain how to increase or decrease runtime brightness controll using 
              trackbar either for image as well as video.
        4. face_detection
            - haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml use for face face_detection in image or video
        5. mask
            - This file contain functionality of masking like how to select specific part of image.
        6. transformation
            -In this folder file contains functionality of how to resize, rotate, scale any image.

### Tutorial2 folder
        1. basics
            - In this multiple files are present which perform basic operations like bitwise operations
              means intersaction of images, union and inverse of images using and, or, not logical operations.
            - core_operations file contains how to slice part of image and also replace any part of image 
              with another image.
            - mouse_event file contains how to show the selected pixel value on cv2 window. Draw lines by
              clicking on window. select any pixel color by click on image appears on cv2 window.
            - trackbar file contains how to make multiple trackbar on cv2 window for change runtime controlling_brightness
              values.
        2. imageProcessing
            - gradient_file.ipynb it shows how to controll there threshold of image.
            - HSV_file.ipynb this file holds functionality of controll hsv value using trackbar.
# Numpy
    - numpy_file.ipynb this file contains functionality of numpy.array slice, flip image, rotate image
      
# Hash_of_images
    - this files shows the hash value of image
# metadata
    - this files shows the meta data of image
# PIL
    - PIL_file.ipynb files contains cropping, resizing, image transpose, plt subploting
      text watermark, image use as watermark, color enhancement, channel shift

# easyocr_Basics
    - easyocr.ipynb In this EasyOcr model useed to recognize text from id card.
    - above mention file return json file. This json file use in
      anotation_using_json_values.ipynb to draw annotation on card
